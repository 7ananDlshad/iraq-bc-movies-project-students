# Movie Project
This is a movie database project, where it shows movies, their casts, ratings, trailers, related movies, genres, and so on.

This project uses The Movie DB API: `https://api.themoviedb.org/3`. It is up to
you to use your Google and Postman skills to explore the API and understand the
data.
