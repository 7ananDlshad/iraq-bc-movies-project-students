# Movie Project
This is a movie database project, where it shows movies, their casts, ratings, trailers, related movies, genres, and so on.

This project uses The Movie DB API: `https://api.themoviedb.org/3`. It is up to
you to use your Google and Postman skills to explore the API and understand the
data.

### Navbar Component
Add a universal navbar (it appears on every page) to the home page that includes
buttons that go to the following pages:

- Home button, takes you to the home page.
- Search box where you can type the movie or actor name and display the
related results. Logic will be added later, just add a dummy search bar. **It should be a component.**

### Main Component
Add an empty main section below the navbar and above the footer. It can be empty for now.

### Footer Component
Add a universal footer that includes:

- Credit to you and your partner for building the website, 
- You and your partner's github link inside an icon and optionally, your social
  media links.

### Styling

- you can style the components yourself, import the stylesheet from JavaScript, not in HTML
- Optionally: you can use react-bootstrap library. Search on how to install it and get started using it
